	<p>I recently setup Exim4, ClamAV and SpamAssassin on my VPS. I found many useful resources, but <a href="http://www.maretmanu.org/homepage/inform/exim-spam.php">this one</a> was fantastic.</p>
	
	<p>I found an <a href="http://www.taugh.com/greylist.pdf">interesting paper</a> on greylisting. I've use grey listing for a long time as the sole method to reduce spam. Basically almost 100% of spam is blocked by grey listing.</p>

	<p>Occasionally legitimate email is blocked as well. However, one thing which I have found helps, is that I've whitelisted my entire country .nz. Most spam I get is from .com domains, so this has helped a lot.</p>

	<p>The biggest problem with grey listing is non-conformant SMTP servers that don't handle errors properly.</p>
	
	<p>You can see a diagram of what I finally ended up creating <a href="http://www.oriontransfer.co.nz/services/internet-services">here</a>, under <em>Spam Protection</em>.</p>

	<p>I am learning to play Shakuhachi. It is quite difficult for me. I can play a regular western style flute proficiently.</p>

	<p>Here are some links I have found useful:</p>

		<li><a href="http://www.stickman-escrima.com/Products/playing.htm">How to play your shakuhachi flute</a></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Phil Nyokai James has made <a href="http://nyokai.com/listen.shtml">several excerpts</a> available online. I enjoyed to listen to these.</p>

	<p>I also found a <a href="http://www.japanshakuhachi.com/gettingstarted.html">fingering guide</a>.. Thankfully, I think I have found a local teacher who has been training in Japan.</p>

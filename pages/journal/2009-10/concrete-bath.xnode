	<p>I am designing and building a concrete bath. I've found many interesting sites about this.</p>

		<li><a href="http://tions.net/CA256EA900408BD5/vwWWW/house~04~04">Solar Heated Outdoor Bath</a></li>

		<li><a href="http://www.bartokdesign.com/japan/">Hinoki Wood Japanese Bathtubs</a></li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>I called <a href="http://www.wairaustone.co.nz/">Wairau Stone</a> who were exceedingly helpful and friendly. They provided the following recipe.</p>
	
	<p>Using a 40L bucket:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>2 buckets of Pumice</li>
		<li>2 buckets of clean fine sand</li>
		<li>3/4 buckets of portland cement</li>
		<li>1 cup <a href="http://www.stonewerx.co.nz/stonemasonry/cladding/febtite-powder-kilos-p-89.html">Febtite</a></li>
		<li>1/3 cup oxide color</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p><a href="http://www.pottingmix.co.nz/">Canterbury Landscape Supplies Ltd</a> is able to supply pumice and sand. There are a number of different grades available. I will probably be using 3-5mm air-dryed.</p>

	<p>I am planning to use a technique called <a href="http://www.ferrocement.com">Ferrocement</a> where you build the shape out of chicken wire and galvanised steel mesh. Then with the concrete you “plaster” it on to build the shape you are after.</p>

	<p>Here is a video about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7IGsG0TzUo">applying ferrocement</a>.</p>

	<p>On another note, I found this <a href="http://video.bobvila.com/m/21328186/building-with-polystyrene-forms-and-concrete.htm" >great video</a> about building houses using concrete using a very interesting polystyrene technique.</p>

	<p>I have made some improvements to RubyDNS. The primary improvements are bug fixes, but there are also a number of changes designed to improve performance.</p>

	<p>To make it easier to make a DNS daemon, I have also improved RExec. RExec is a tool that allows you to make the daemon easily. The primary improvements center around making it easier to drop priviledges and better error reporting when starting a daemon.</p>

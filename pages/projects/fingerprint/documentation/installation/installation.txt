Usage: fingerprint [options] [path]
This script is used to create and compare file system fingerprints.

Directory analysis and verification:
    -a, --analyze [path]             Generage a fingerprint of the given path and save it for later verification.
    -v, --verify [path]              Verify a given path based on a previously saved fingerprint.
    -n name                          Specify the name of the fingerprint file.
                                     Default: ._fingerprint.txt
    -f                               Force any operation to complete despite warnings.

Low level operations:
    -c                               Compare the given fingerprints. Check that the second fingerprint is a superset of the first.
    -o [output-path]                 Write the fingerprint output to the given file.
        --verbose                    Verbose output, include additional details in the file transcript.

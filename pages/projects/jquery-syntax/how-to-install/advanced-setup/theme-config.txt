# to support a website which doesn't have the right
# css for .syntax and .syntax-container layout.
depends:
    - base
# This adds code to existing css generation files - when 
# the specified file is processed, this file is also 
# included at the end.
extends:
    "jquery.syntax.core.sass": "_jquery.syntax.core.sass"
# Specifies files to prefix on every other file processed.
# Normally you wouldn't declare rules in this as they would
# end up duplicated in every CSS file generated.

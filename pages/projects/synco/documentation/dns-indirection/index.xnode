	<p>Synco uses hostnames to control backup behaviour. If you use DNS CNAME records, you can control which server is the master.</p>
	
	<p>If you have a cluster of serveral machines, this allows you to have them synchronizing, but you can change the master server simply by editing the DNS CNAME record.</p>

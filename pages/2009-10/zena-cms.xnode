	<p><a href="http://zenadmin.org/en">Zena</a> is a Rails CMS solution. It has many interesting features, such as supporting multiple languages and multiple sites from a single installation. I look forward to trying it out.</p>
	
	<p>One of the interesting things about the package is that it has been built from the ground up to be a unique and cohesive product. For example, the live editing functionality, the smart tagging/templating system, all look great.</p>

	<p>I found this information very interesting. <a href="http://jacquesmattheij.com/be-consultant">How to be a Consultant, a freelancer or an independent contractor</a>. It has a great set of ideas and concepts related to all areas of being an independent consultant. This is primarily what I do for a job, so I found it to be a great summary of many things I already know, and also insightful into some areas which I have not thought about yet.</p>

	<p>I've listened to a number of podcasts from <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> and I think they are great. When you buy something 50% of the amount you pay goes directly to the musicians. They have a huge catalog and you can download and listen to music and then decide if you want to buy it.</p>

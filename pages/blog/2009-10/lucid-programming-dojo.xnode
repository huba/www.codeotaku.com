	<p>Earlier this week we ran the <a href="http://www.lucidsystems.co.nz/community/dojo">Lucid Programming Dojo</a> courses for the first time. There were two courses, a Introduction to the Shell course, and an Introduction to Ruby course.</p>

	<p>I was teaching the Ruby course (2 days) and it was fantastic. The course was at an italian restaurant and it was filled with fantastic food. In the first day we covered <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">Ruby basics</a>, and in the second day we played around with <a href="http://datamapper.org">DataMapper</a> and <a href="http://ramaze.net/">Ramaze</a>.</p>

	<p>All in all, it was great fun and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I look forward to the next time I get a chance to teach!</p>
